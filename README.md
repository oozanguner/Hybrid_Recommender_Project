# Hybrid_Recommender_Project

The Goal of The Project

In online store, to recommend the right 10 products for right customer.

While I was doing this, I used 4 different approaches.

The plot above shows the number of total products of most purchased categories in all dataset according to day and time.

My aim in creating a hybrid model using more than one approach in my project is collecting the recommendations from four different models and then suggesting these recommendations randomly to customers. Thus, I reduce the risk of recommending the same products to the consumer or not recommending any products at all.

If equipment capacity is available in next step, I recommend to write the products to be recommended to a high-dimensional dataset containing the products to be recommended for each product in the project every day. Then, when the user added a product to the cart, you could run the program much faster by reading the products to be recommended from the data set corresponding to the product in this data set.

#### NOTE: YOU SHOULD RUN create_data.py FILE BEFORE YOU START THE PROJECT FOR DOWNLOADING THE DATAFRAMES WHICH USED IN THIS PROJECT.
